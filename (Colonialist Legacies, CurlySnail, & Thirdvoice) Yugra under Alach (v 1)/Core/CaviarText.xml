			<Text>Caviar are sturgeon eggs harvested from inside the fish before they are laid. Despite the gross origin, they are often seen as a sign of nobility or wealth. The difficult and harmful practice of farming caviar has limited the industry, and prices for Caviar have remained consistently high. The term caviar can also refer to various other types of fish eggs.</Text>
