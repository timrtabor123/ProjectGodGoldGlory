			<Text>Nikolai Spiridonov, later known as Teki Odulok, was born in 1906 in the old village of Nelemnoe. Part of a growing community of Yukaghir intelligentsia, Teki Odulok was a prominent Siberian anthropologist, as well as a promising writer. One of his stories, the Life of Imteurgin the Elder, received praise from people throughout the Russian literary world. The young Spiridonov found himself a promising future- but one that would not last.</Text>

Various institutions, including a tribal community, are named after Teki Odulok- the Little Yukaghir.</Text>

			<Text>May you walk the path of enlightenment, oh wise Teki Odulok of the Yukaghir. It was with pen and mind that you wrote the stories of the Siberian peoples, redefining the literary traditions of the Yukaghir. However, writing was not your only specialty- you were a man of science, with a keen eye for politics. Your proposal to form the Yukaghir-Chuvantsy State would've doubtless helped the cause of your people, but it was not meant to be. Accused of being a Japanese spy by the Soviet regime, you were tried and executed, leaving behind your wife and son. So the tale was destined to end.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The world needs a little more light, and it's up to you to guide your people as the brightest stars in the sky. Can you discover vast new territories, rich with the finest of hunts? Can you prove yourself where once you failed? Can you build a civilization that can stand the test of time?</Text>

Stories about the proud past of the Yukaghir were retained from generational stories, and finally recorded in text thanks to the work of proud Yukaghir writers. Today, Yukaghir intelligentsia struggle to maintain their land and earn new land rights for their people.</Text>
