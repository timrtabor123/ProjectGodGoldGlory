			<Text>The Kalinago, also known as the Island Caribs or simply Caribs, are an indigenous people of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean. At the time of Spanish contact, the Caribs were one of the dominant groups in the Caribbean, which owes its name to them. They lived throughout the Windward Islands, Dominica, and possibly the southern Leeward Islands. Historically it was thought their ancestors were mainland Caribs who conquered the islands from their previous inhabitants, known as the Igneri.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the early colonial period, the Caribs had a reputation as warriors who raided neighboring islands. Early Europeans claimed that they practiced cannibalism – the word "cannibal" derives from a corruption of their name. Today, the Caribs and their descendants continue to live in the Antilles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Like most of the indigenous peoples of the New World, the Kalinago suffered greatly from European Colonization of the Americas European conquest, and their descendants are now scattered throughout the Caribbean and South America, with the largest group living on the island of Dominica where the British established a reservation for them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Today, Carib make effort to preserve their culture and educate their children and others about their traditions, maintaining their identity while at the same time being part of the contemporary society.</Text>

In a sudden turn of affairs, however, he led a small band of survivors who had rejected slavery on a deadly escape over a cliff, which the French named Morne de Sauteurs or “Leapers Hill.” Today his daring act is mythologized as a reminder of the Indigenous resistance in the region.</Text>

			<Text>Mabrika Ouboutou Kairouane, chief of the Kalinago people of Grenada! For a century the Kalinago succesfully resisted Spanish settlement and it wasn't until the 1650s that the French and English permanently settled there. While you agreed to peacefully partition the island between you, you remained ever suspicious. However, too late it was when you realized the mistake of allowing them to settle, and the armed conflict that followed and lasted five years should prove to be your final hour. When, at the last kalinago stand on Grenada, your army was all but defeated, instead of surrending, you and your remaining 40 warriors took the deadly escape over a cliff. Now called "Leapers Hill", that cliff is to this day a symbol of the Kalinagos' struggle against European colonization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kairouane, your people call upon you to once again lead them through battle, on raids and against colonists. Will the foreigners once again be met with unyielding resistance, war canoe parties attacking from every seaside? Will you build an empire that stands the test of time?</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_DMS_KARBAY_TEXT">
			<Text>Also written in French as "Carbet". A term used by the French to describe the main meetinghouse and settlements of the Caribs. The Caribs themselves called this house "Taboui", but the French settlers had picked up the name "Karbay" when they had lived among the Tupi-guarani tribe of Amerindians in Brazil. The French had also brought many Tupi-guarani people from Brazil to work for them in Martinique, Dominica and Guadeloupe. These people used their own language to describe familiar things that they saw in Dominica. Several words that today are passed off as Carib have their origins in the Tupi-guarani language. This word "Karbay" is one of them. It was used so often in the new French/Carib/Tupi-guarani/Creole language that was emerging, that succeeding generations of Caribs abandoned their own word "Taboui" and adopted "Karbay". It has been used for so long by the Caribs, that today it is considered by them to be a Carib word.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Karbay was a large building, in most cases about 60 feet long and thirty feet wide. It was made of tall round wood posts and was of an oval shape with a tall steep roof. The posts which supported the roof were also used to tie hammocks for sleeping. The roof was thatched with palm leaves or the leaves of "roseaux" reeds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A Kalinago village is made of a small amount of houses, and among these houses, there would be a Karbay. A Karbay is a large meetinghouse, where important people such as the chief and the headmen would meet. This Karbay was usually 90-60 feet long, and it could hold about 120 hammocks. Despite it being so massive and important, the only way in to the Karbay was a small door. There were a lot large posts that were used to support the roof, and the hammocks would hang off of these posts.</Text>
