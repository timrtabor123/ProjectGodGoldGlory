				The Rock at Pagua is home to a powerful spirit. A small white flower grows near the rock, however it blooms only one day a year. Anyone lucky enough to find it, should rub the bloom in the palm of their hand. Upon doing so, legend says that if they point their palm towards someone they wish to have control over, while calling their name, will have control over that person! While this is naturally just a legend, it is true that a infrequently blooming white flower grows near the rock and the tea made from its leaves is both strongly hallucinogenic and psychedelic!
