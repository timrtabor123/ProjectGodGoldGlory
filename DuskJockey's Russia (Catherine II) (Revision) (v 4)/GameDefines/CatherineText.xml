			<Text>A finishing school is a school for young people that focuses on teaching social graces and upper-class cultural rites as a preparation for entry into society. The name reflects that it follows on from ordinary school and is intended to complete the education, with classes primarily on deportment and etiquette, with academic subjects secondary.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first Russian finishing schools were built during the reign of Catherine the Great. These 'Institutes for Noble Maidens', as they were called, were meant to create 'a new race of men' and were founded on the principles of Enlightenment philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</Text>

It increases the City's [ICON_RESEARCH] Science output by 33% and yields +1 [ICON_RESEARCH] Science for every two Citizens. In addition, the Finishing School also provides +1 [ICON_HAPPINESS_1] Happiness to its city. If built in a city with a cultural Guild, however, the Finishing School costs no [ICON_GOLD] Gold maintenance and provides double the [ICON_HAPPINESS_1] Happiness. It's quite worthwhile to construct these useful buildings in all Russian cities, but especially in your scientific and cultural centers.</Text>
