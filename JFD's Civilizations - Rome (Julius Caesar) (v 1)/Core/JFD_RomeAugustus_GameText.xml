			<Text>Ancient Rome played a pivotal role in the history of wine. The Roman belief that wine was a daily necessity made the drink "democratic" and ubiquitous; in various forms, it was available to slaves, peasants, women and aristocrats alike. To ensure the steady supply of wine to Roman soldiers and colonists, viticulture and wine production spread to every part of the empire. The economic opportunities presented by trading in wine drew merchants to do business with tribes native to Gaul and Germania, bringing Roman influences to these regions even before the arrival of the Roman military.</Text>
