				We have long abided by a set of laws which impose a value upon every man, and which accords a price to any who would offend this value. But not all the tribes within our empire follow these laws, making them difficult to uphold. We should resolve this, and institutionalise the Weregild amongst the various Germanic tribes within our empire.[NEWLINE]
