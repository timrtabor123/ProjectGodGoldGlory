			<Text>Closely related to the French word “Chateau” in meaning, a Schloss is a type of castle that is often used as a sort of second home for nobility. Schlosser were not known for having many defensive components built into them, only really built for purposes of showing off wealth and complementing the nobility’s extravagant lifestyle. In Bavaria in particular, Schlosser were designed to have a classical revival theme around them, with true Enlightenment era architecture. Often, a Schloss would have several other features to give even more of an impression of being incredibly wealthy; a “Wasserschloss”, which loosely translates to “Water Castle”, was simply a Schloss with a moat. This would have been unnecessary for purposes of defense - very few people thought that as an integral part of their castles at the time - but it showed of wealth and grandeur greatly, adding to the romanticism of the design. The interior of these buildings would have also been very nicely decorated, adding to the general feel of the castle as a getaway for the rich. Neuschwanstein Castle - one of the most expensive and luxurious castles build in world history - is known as “Schloss Neuschwanstein” in Germany, making it possibly the strongest contender for the finest example of a Schloss.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A Schloss is a unique improvement available only to Bavaria. It may not be adjacent to another Schloss and can only be constructed on Hills. Whenever a Schloss is constructed, it yields [ICON_GREAT_PEOPLE] Great Musician points for the Capital equal to two times your current [ICON_CULTURE] Culture output. It gains +1 [ICON_CULTURE] Culture for every adjacent Mountain tile. It cannot be removed.</Text>

Unique to such complexes, the Gempaaten was constructed without a roof, exposing its offering tables to direct sunlight. This is likely to reflect the important status of the Solar Deity, Aten, under Akhenaten; Gempaaten literally means: 'The Sun Disc is Found in the Estate of the God Aten.'</Text>
