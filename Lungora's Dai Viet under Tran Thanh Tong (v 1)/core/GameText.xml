				Beginning with the rule of Din Tien Hoang (r. 968–979), the country of Dai Viet was officially established. The term "Viet" is the same as the Chinese word "Yue", a name in ancient times of various non-Chinese groups who lived in what is now northern/southern China and northern Viet Nam, though the Viet People had been for a long time a melting pot of both Yue and Tai peoples. In 1010 Ly Thai To, founder of the Ly Dynasty, issued the "Edict on the Transfer of the Capital" and moved the capital of Dai Viet to Thang Long and built the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long where the Hanoi Citadel would later stand.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Dai Viet is a strategic location. By invading Dai Viet, the Mongols would be able to bypass the Himalaya and drive deep into South East Asia. However, the Mongolians of the Yuan Dynasty invaded Dai Viet three times and were defeated by the Tran Dynasty under the rule of Tran Hung Dao. The last battle, the Battle of Bach Dang, was a decisive defeat for the Mongolians. Dai Viet's perseverance thwarted Mongolian attempts to conquer South East Asia and prevented the third Mongolian invasion of Japan, as the Mongol navy was completely destroyed during Bach Dang. This became one the greatest victories in Vietnamese military history.

				Heaven's fortunes be upon you Tran Tranh Tong. You inherited your father's Empire, his legacy, and his enemies. The Mongols controlled China to the north and looked greedily towards your lands. They came three times. Each you, your brother, and the noble Viet people fended them off. But winning wars against great odds was not the only feat you achieved. You built up the grand citadels of Thang Long, Thanh Hoa, and Thanh Dong. You patronised the arts and sciences, bringing Dai Viet into a new age of prosperity and even introducing the first exclusively Viet written language allowing your court to write in its own way rather than that of China. The Tran dynasty would rule on in prosperity from the foundations you built and feats you achieved. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Great Tran Thanh Tong, the Viets call to you once more. Will you answer them and fend off the empires at the gates and be a champion of science and culture once more? Can you build an empire to stand the test of time?

				Cam Quan translates approximately to "Royal Army". Much like most states of the period Dai Viet's military was compromised primarily by peasant levies, but they did have a professional standing army. Historically these were some of the only troops that would be outfitted with sets of high quality lamelar and afforded mounts. The Cam Quan specifically are meant to represent the Royal Army under the leadership of Tran Thanh Tong's brother: Prince Tran Hung Dao who is regarded as one of the premier generals of history. Under his leadership the Cam Quan and levy support wrecked havoc upon the armies of invading Mongols. They cut supply lines, ambushed small portions of the invading force isolated, and made heavy use of the waterways of North Vietnam to out maneuver their foes. The Battle of Bach Dang is both the most famous and most awesome of Tran Hung Dao's exploits where he forced the entire invading fleet of Mongol-controlled China into a land battle with his cavalry, slaughtering and incinerating the entire enemy force with careful knowledge of the river's ebbing tides.

				The Cam Quan is the Dai Viet's signature unit, a hard hitting fast moving danger to all who oppose you. It's best used as a hit and run unit, picking off enemies (particularly cavalry with its 33% bonus) that your ranged and siege units have weakened, refreshing its moves to do so a second time before utilising its ability to move after attack across a river or into a fort and defend. Tran Hung Dao used the Cam Quan to slaughter many foes including the Yuan navy; while the Cam Quan in civ can't quite attack boats make sure to use its Amphibious promotion to safely and effectively destroy enemy units who think themselves safe hiding across a river from you.

				Vo Mieu translates into "Martial Temple" from Vietnamese, though they were not and aren't truly religious sites. The Vo Mieu are centres of learning and worship, with dedication to the heroes and generals of the Viet people. Trang Hung Dao, Prince and brother of Tran Thanh Tong is the most revered figure of these temples, though many others are worshipped and taught from too. Military sciences are the primary education topic, but all forms of literature is studied in the Vo Mieu, from poetry to sciences to the workibgs of state. Tran Thanh Tong financed the construction of many many Vo Mieu and used them both to spread his new written language for the Viet but also as administration centres to control and lead the countryside in confucian style.
