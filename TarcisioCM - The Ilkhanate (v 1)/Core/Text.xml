			<Text>The Ilkhanate was a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire, which was ruled by the Mongol House of Hulagu. It was established in the 13th century and was based primarily in Iran as well as neighboring territories, such as present-day Azerbaijan, and the central and eastern parts of present-day Turkey. In its fullest extent, the state expanded into territories which today comprise most of Iran, Iraq, Turkmenistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, western Afghanistan and southwestern Pakistan. Later Ilkhanate rulers, beginning with Ghazan in 1295, would convert to Islam.</Text>

			<Text>Mahmud Ghazan was the seventh ruler of the Mongol Empire's Ilkhanate division in modern-day Iran from 1295 to 1304. He was the son of Arghun and Quthluq Khatun, continuing a long line of rulers who were direct descendants of Genghis Khan. Considered the most prominent of the Ilkhans, he is best known for making a political conversion to Islam in 1295 when he took the throne, marking a turning point for the dominant religion of Mongols in West Asia (Iran, Iraq, Anatolia and Trans-Caucassia).</Text>

			<Text>Hail Ilkhan Ghazan of the house of Hulagu, seventh ruler of the Subordinate Khanate. The Ilkhanate was formed through great terror, as the Mongol hordes swept through Iran, Iraq and Syria; the utter destruction of Baghdad being the greatest testament of the destructive power of the Mongols. You, however, was no mindless brute. A man of high culture and able reformer, you had a great lasting legacy not only for converting the Ilkhanate to Islam but also due to your sweeping reforms in the economy, military and civil services of the Ilkhanate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Oh distinguished Ilkhan, the once mighty Mongol empire has crumbled and dissipated, its legacy long gone.
