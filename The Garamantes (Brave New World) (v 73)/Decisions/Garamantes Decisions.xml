			<Text>Aghrem is the Berber term for what is roughly known in Arabic as a Qasr. Strictly speaking, these terms may refer to an individual fort-like defensive structure or the entirety of a fortified town. Due to the limited nature of surviving Garamantian textual evidence, it is uncertain what the Garamantes themselves called their fortified cities. The Arabic Qasr is the term most often employed today when discussing Libyan architecture (both ancient and modern) in general. However, the Garamantian structure is perhaps best understood as a precursor building and not identical to the modern Qasr. It is also possible that Igherman, the plural of Aghrem, may be a linguistic cognate for the name Garamantes itself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Garamantian cities were often structured around a central square Aghrem. These Igherman would have attached houses as well as collective granaries. However, it is not entirely correct to describe Igherman exclusively as fortified granaries, which is often the case in modern literature.  While granaries were included within an Aghrem, they formed just one part of a larger whole which also usually included religious and commercial structures. Igherman were often situated in mountain locations to aid in defense, as well as contained within a single, continuous wall.</Text>
