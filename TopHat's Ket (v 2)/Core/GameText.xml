            <Text>The Ket, sometimes called the Yenisei Ostyaks, are an indigenous people of Siberia, who live along the Yenisei River. They traditionally lived a predominantly hunter-gatherer lifestyle, although some of the more northern Ket also engaged in pastoralism. The Ket language, the sole survivor of the Yeniseian language family, is thought by some scholars to be related to the Na-Den√© languages of North America; if this theory is true, it will be the first confirmed language family that connects the Americas to Eurasia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Ket have a patriarchal society, divided into two exogamous moieties - that is, clans whose members traditionally only marry members of the other clan. Shamanism is central to Ket religious life. The predominant types of shaman are the sening and the bangos. A sening largely communicates with the spirit world, and is typically associated with the sky; more detail can be found on the Sening page. The bangos, meanwhile, is more associated with the earth and medicine; a bangos is traditionally believed to know both good and evil spells, in contrast to the more straightforwardly good sening.</Text>

        <Row Tag="TXT_KEY_PEDIA_THP_KET_TEXT_2">
            <Text>It is believed that the earliest ancestors of the Ket lived near the Altai mountains, but after being displaced twice by hostile steppe confederations, migrated to their current location. The first displacement is attributed to a group called the Tystad, who are thought to be the Huns, placing that migration in the third century AD; the second displacement is credited to the Kiliki, who may have been the Kirghiz of the ninth century AD. In their current location, the Ket developed good relationships with the Selkup to the west; conversely, the Evenks to the east were perennial rivals, and most Ket folk heroes achieved their fame in battle against Evenki opponents.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Russians arrived in Ket territory beginning in the seventeenth century, and the Ket way of life was largely suppressed. Today, there are slightly over 1000 Ket people still alive, and only about 100 fluent speakers of the Ket language.</Text>

            <Text>Olgit was a warrior figure and hero from Ket mythology. Like many traditional Ket heroes, Olgit distinguished himself in battle against the Evenks; Evenki raiders frequently attacked the Ket, providing the basis for such stories. Olgit was also the progenitor of the Qengtandeng moiety, one of the two exogamous marriage groups into which the Ket divided themselves. Like many other Ket heroes, Olgit was eventually immortalized as a mountainous crag along the eastern bank of the Yenisei River.</Text>

Your people are one of the most enigmatic of Siberia, with only a thousand living to the present day, and an ill-attested language that may even be related to those of North America. Even so, you are remembered as one of their great heroes, achieving many victories against the hated Evenks and becoming the original ancestor of the great Qengtandeng clan. Your deeds were immortalized by the gods, who honored you by turning you into a crag along the banks of the Yenisei River.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Olgit, all the Ket shamans of today seek your intercession, calling for you above all other spirits. Can you forge an existence in some of the harshest terrains on Earth? Can you rally your hunters and shamans to conquer your enemies? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?</Text>

            <Text>The sening was the most important type of shaman in Ket society. The sening largely operated by invoking the spirit world, which they did by performing s√©ances during the twilight hours; these were believed to be most effective when the sun and moon were simultaneously visible in the sky. A sening was believed to be aided by sky spirits, known as esdeng, and as a sening grew in power he would have greater numbers of esdeng assisting him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Central to Ket shamanism is the concept of 'qut', which refers both to the gift of shamanism and to the songs that a shaman would perform. Qut typically manifested in young adults, who would enter a state called 'dariy' in which they begun behaving oddly: typical manifestations of dariy included sudden unsociable behavior or inexplicable urges to sing or dance. It is believed that, if a youth experiencing dariy refused the call to shamanism, he would go permanently insane or die.</Text>
