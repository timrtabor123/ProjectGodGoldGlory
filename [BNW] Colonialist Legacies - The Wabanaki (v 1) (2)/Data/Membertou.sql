In addition to his political prowess, he was also considered to be a healer and a prophet, the spiritual leader of his people.'),

As leader of his people, Membertou determined the course of all Wabanaki actions, and the very future of his people. And, of course, in the 16th century, the Wabanaki would find themselves at the crossroads of the new age of colonists.'),

He was described as a tall, powerfully built man with a well-kept beard -- an oddity for the Mi''kmaq. History about Membertou is interlaced with legend: some writings claim that Membertou kept a European-style beard because he had seen the French in a dream. More likely, the Wabanaki had observed Europeans in the past, before the ‘‘official’’ first contact. In either case, Henri Membertou threw his lot in with the French, becoming a loyal friend of the strangers from Europe.'),

Membertou was the first indigenous Canadian to be baptized, taking a French name (Henri Membertou) and encouraging the Wabanaki to follow Christianity. Membertou saw Christianity as being the natural conclusion of his own religion, and as the head of the Wabanaki religion, most Wabanaki followed. Membertou encouraged the colonists to teach their priests the Abenaki and Algonquian languages so that they could send missionaries to the Wabanaki to teach them about Christianity. To this day, most Wabanaki are members of the Catholic Church.'),

Membertou pursued Christianity with a passion and forged a strong bond with the Catholic church. Membertou even travelled to Rome and met the Pope, further cementing the relationship between the Wabanaki and the Catholic Church, known as the Mi’kmaw Concordat. Yet a dark omen occurred -- Membertou contracted an infectious disease brought to Canada by the French. The disease would kill him. To his very last day, Membertou supported the French and the Catholic church. His dying words were a change to his children to remain devout Christians. Membertou wanted to be buried unshriven so that his soul would go to Hell, where he planned to spread the joy of his conversion to his ancestors, so that they would have relief in knowing that their people had found the truth at last. He was 104 years old, having lived a full life.'),

He guided his people through the greatest upheaval in world history -- the colonial era, and while it may be argued that he surrendered his people’s culture to the Europeans and that he was indirectly responsible for the loss of the Wabanaki lands, Membertou’s people are among the most resilient of First Nations. As a man faced with an unparalleled crisis, Membertou stands tall among world leaders for his reasonable and responsible actions in navigating the hostile waters of time; his visionary leadership brought salvation, religious or otherwise, to a people in the hostile grip of impending chaos.');
