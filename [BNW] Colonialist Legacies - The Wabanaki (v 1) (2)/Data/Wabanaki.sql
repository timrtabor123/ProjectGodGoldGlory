Politically, the Wabanaki had a uniquely hierarchical system, with a single Grand Chief who was elected by the collected chiefs of the Wabanaki. The Wabanaki were also a spiritual people with a highly developed religion, although some histories imply that the Wabanaki believed that their religion was incomplete and looked forward to some new revelation to appear -- a revelation that presented itself in European Christianity.

The Wabanaki had little trouble taking and using the Europeans’ ships; several of the failed colonies may have in fact been cut off or even destroyed for encroaching upon the Wabanaki waters and the waters or even lands of other tribes. The Wabanaki would then scuttle the European vessels, because the massive ships of the line were not useful for the river-bound life of the Wabanaki.'),

The Wabanaki leaders observed the foreign vessels and their ways and interactions with each other and determined that the French were the most trustworthy.

When the English defeated the French, however, the French not only surrendered their own lands to the British crown, they also ceded the Wabanaki lands and waters, even though they had no right to these lands. When the Wabanaki leaders -- who were all Christians at this point -- protested this takeover, they were told that in the eyes of the Europeans, no non-Christian prince could have right to lands -- a flagrant indicator of the truly temporal nature of the Colonial era. The Wabanaki lands were traded away like a slave on a market. Soon after, the British forcibly dissolved the Wabanaki Confederacy.

In the dark years of American slave trade, the Wabanaki would help free and hide black slaves, and in the years following the American civil war, many Wabanaki formed close friendships and intermarried with African-American communities. Also, one of the contributions of the Wabanaki to world culture was the creation of Hockey. The Wabanaki enjoyed many winter sports, including but not limited to the sport of Oochamadyk. This sport, played with curved wooden sticks, merged with the English sport of shinny to create Hockey.

The Wabanaki also seek to safeguards the lands and waters that were taken from them, in the hopes that one day they will be returned to them. The method of this action has ranged from peaceful politics to violent activism. In the 80s and 90s, some of the Wabanaki turned to ecoterrorism in an attempt to preserve their lands.

Additionally, in 1993, the Wabanaki founded a new Wabanaki Confederacy, reinstating as an organization the old nation that had been forcibly disbanded.

This lawsuit catapulted the plight of the Wabanaki onto the front pages of the nation’s news and the forefront of the minds of Canadians. Since then, the story of the Wabanaki has accelerated, with new changes every day and new achievements for the Wabanaki. In 2008, then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized to the Wabanaki for both the school system and the theft of their lands and waters. In 2015, the Canadian government acknowledged that the cessation of Wabanaki lands was invalid and, while the current state of the land would not be returned to the Wabanaki, the Wabanaki and Canadian government shared a responsibility to steward the land for all people.');
