			<Text>Good day to you, Gough Whitlam, rightful Prime Minister of Australia! Coming into power after over twenty years of conservative government, you passed a record number of policies and social reforms, bringing Australia out of the 1950s and into the modern age! Your government radically changed the Australian economic, legal, and cultural landscape, introducing legal aid, universal healthcare, greater access to both secondary and higher education, increased cultural funding, and much much more. In only three years in office, you achieved far more than others managed in twenty. Truly, you will live on as one of Australia's most influential figures.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Oh Prime Minister, following your controversial and dubious dismissal from office, many of your reforms have been quashed or altered by less visionary ministries. But the people know it's time for your governance once more! Will you bring a new age of progress and reform to your country? Will you build a civilization to stand the test of time?</Text>

			<Text>For most of its history, the land known as "Australia" has been inhabited by various Aboriginal peoples, who were isolated from the rest of the world. Upon the European discovery of this vast landmass in 1606, many countries tried to take portions of it. Eventually, the British took the entire island of Australia, turning it into one of their most prosperous - and largest - colonies. Due to the vast amount of available land, the British Empire sent convicts to the territory, as a way of keeping the British Isles crime-free. Eventually, in 1901, Australia got its first Prime Minister, and eventually independence from Great Britain. As a newly-formed nation, Australia joined the First and Second World Wars, helping to put its place on the world map. Today, Australia is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world, as well as having strong economic and political links with other countries.</Text>

			<Text>Due to the large desert regions in Central Australia, the majority of the population live on the coast. Australia has several notable geographical features, such as Uluru, a sacred Aboriganal site; the Great Barrier Reef, off the north coast; and the Outback, a large, arid area in the middle of Australia. Due to the extreme heat in Australia's summer months, there are often bushfires which involve shrubs and plantlife being set on fire by the intense warming. These can cause a lot of trouble to Australians, and can be potentially deadly if not controlled properly.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_SENSHI_WHITLAM_TEXT_3">
			<Text>Before the 18th century, Australia was mostly inhabited by Aboriginals. They were probably originally from Asia, although they would not be classified as "Asian". About 50,000 years ago, there was a migration of these people to Australia, where they settled and lived in an isolated state for the next 49,700 or so years. The Aboriginals inhabited most of Australia, even some of the arid desert parts in the centre. However, most Aboriginals were located in the northern parts of the continent. Even today, there is still a small amount of these people, making up only 3% of Australia's total population. Most Aboriginals are now in the Northern Territory province of the country.</Text>

			<Text>The first outside sighting of Australia was made by a Dutch navigator called Willem Janszoon. On the 26th of February 1606, Janszoon landed at what is now Cape York, Queensland. He later went on to map 320 km of Australia's coastline, thinking it part of New Guinea. He named the land "Nieu Zeland", but the name didn't catch on. Over the course of that century, Dutch navigators charted the whole island, which they now named "New Holland", but never attempted to colonize. Over the next 200 years several voyages were made, but the most important was probably James Cook's expedition. Cook mapped the unknown South of Australia, which he called New South Wales. This was soon to grow into Britain's settlement on the island.</Text>

			<Text>With the loss of its 13 colonies in America in 1780, the British Empire sent a fleet to start colonizing Australia. On the 26th of January 1788 the British flag was raised at Sydney Cove, proclaiming the land a British settlement. Today, the 26th of January is celebrated as Australia Day. The site for this first colony later became Sydney. Eventually Britain split the island into several different colonial settlements, each with different governments, which today serve as regional divisions in Australia. They were used for different things by the British - most of them had some convict focus, except for South Australia, which was notably a "free colony".</Text>

			<Text>Australia was by this point a thriving British settlement, although it had no central government. The British eventually decided to use this vast land as a convict settlement by sending British prisoners to the mostly uninhabited land. From the start convicts had been used to establish initial colonies, but now there were larger prisons to house convicts in. Most of the time, the crimes they did were harmless - such as steal a loaf of bread - but all the same Britain used it as a convict settlement, perhaps to give people an even better reason not to commit crimes. The largest prison was Port Arthur in Tasmania, which was used for re-offending criminals.</Text>

			<Text>During the 1850s a gold rush began in Australia. It started in New South Wales and Victoria, but quickly spread across the island. The colonies' economies greatly benefited from this as it brought a lot of extra value to both the land and the amount of people in the settlements. While many people got massively rich off this, most of the people taking part in it didn't and instead took advantage of Australia's land laws and started farming.</Text>

Australia was pretty much an independent state at this point, but in 1931 the Statute of Westminster ended most constitutional ties between Britain and Australia.

There have been a few attempts to end the monarchy and proclaim Australia a republic, but the majority of Australian voters are opposed to this.</Text>

			<Text>Gough Whitlam, Prime Minister of Australia from 1972 to 1975, was one of the most skillful and controversial leaders of the Australian Labor party. As Prime Minister, he introduced a record number of policies and social reforms, but his government was controversially dismissed by Governor-General John Kerr under dubious and disheartening circumstances.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With a vigorous campaign whose slogan was "It's Time," Whitlam led the Labor party to victory on December 2, 1972. The party gained a majority in the House of Representatives, winning 67 seats, and Whitlam became the first Labor prime minister in 23 years, but Labor did not gain a majority in the Senate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whitlam overturned the slow-moving bureaucracy of the Liberal-Country party coalition which had ruled since 1949 and instituted rapid changes in policy. He pushed for better treatment for aborigines and a limit to U.S. and British influence in Australia. He ordered Australian troops to return from Vietnam, where they were fighting in support of American policies, and ended the military draft. But soon the international oil shortage and Whitlam's dramatic increases in government spending led to serious economic problems: first inflation and then stagnation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Liberal-Country majority in the Senate blocked several major pieces of Labor's legislative package. Seeking a stronger mandate, Whitlam called an election in May 1974. He remained prime minister, but Labor lost seats in the House of Representatives and failed to gain a majority in the Senate. Despite the deteriorating economic situation and bitter disputes within his own party, Whitlam continued his attempts to create a "new" Australia, changing the relationships between the central, state, and local levels of government. He introduced ideas about participatory democracy at the local level and using the public service to set the pace for wages and workers' rights. But many of his policies were bitterly opposed at home and by the United States. His efforts to develop a more independent role for Australia and his criticism of American policies in southeast Asia antagonized Washington.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The rising Liberal party under the new leadership of Malcolm Fraser and a critical mass media put Whitlam's government on the defensive. Scandals undermined public trust. The most damaging was the Loans Affair, in which the government tried improper means of raising several hundred million dollars from Arab oil sources. The deputy prime minister was forced to resign, and the minister for minerals and energy was fired. The Senate, under Fraser, challenged the Labor government by refusing to pass the budget. Whitlam called for an immediate election in the Senate. Instead, on November 11, 1975, the governor-general, Sir John Kerr, a Labor appointee, dismissed Whitlam as prime minister, appointed Fraser as "caretaker" prime minister, dissolved both houses of Parliament, and called an election. Shocked, Whitlam declared it a day of shame and called for Australians to "maintain their rage" and carry it into the election. His appeal failed. The Labor party soundly lost the 1975 election, with only 40 percent of the vote.</Text>

			<Text>The GAF Nomad is a utility aircraft produced by the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) of Australia in Melbourne. Supported by the Australian Government, design work began in the mid-1960s, and it made its maiden flight on 23 July 1971. Despite some export sales and commercial operations, sales were not as sufficient and production stopped in 1985. The twin-turboprop, high-wing aircraft has a retractable gear and came in two variants: the initial N22, followed by the stretched N24.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, the Australian Army and the Australian Customs Service were major users. The Australian military withdrew almost all of its remaining Nomads amid reports of safety concerns during the 1990s.

			<Text>While Australia technically only has one 'National Gallery', there are nationally-owned galleries in almost every state capital which fulfil the same purpose - two of them were or are also called the National Gallery! The Whitlam government brought with it a hughe increase in cultural funding, much of which went to national galleries or similar institutions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1973, the National Gallery of Australia, then called the Australian National Gallery, bought the painting "Blue Poles" by contemporary artist Jackson Pollock for US$2 million – about a third of its annual budget. This required Whitlam's personal permission, which he gave on the condition the price was publicized. The purchase created a political and media scandal, and was said to symbolise, alternatively, Whitlam's foresight and vision or his profligate spending. Following his resignation from politics, Whitlam was appointed chairman of the National Gallery.</Text>
